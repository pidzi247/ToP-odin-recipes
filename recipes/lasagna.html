  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>With more than 15,000 5-star reviews, this fan-favorite lasagna 
    has to top the list. The consensus among reviewers: While this 
    recipe does take over two hours to make, this lasagna tastes 
    like it's from an Italian restaurant, even for first-time cooks. 
    Calling it the world's best may be a little bold, but it 
    certainly is Allrecipes' best lasagna.</p>
  <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>STEPS</h2>
  <ol>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and 
      garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed 
      tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with 
      sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon 
      salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for 
      about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
      lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain 
      noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine 
      ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon 
      salt.</li>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom 
      of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over 
      meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese 
      mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. 
      Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle 
      with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with 
      remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to 
      prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or 
      make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and 
      bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before 
      serving.</li>
  </ol>
